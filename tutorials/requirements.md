# Requirements

So you want to build a mobile app. The first thing you'll need for this tutorial is a computer with a code editor such as:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- [Sublime Text](https://sublimetext.com)
- [Brackets](http://brackets.io)
- Other options: https://alternativeto.net/software/sublime-text

We'll also be using the terminal/comamnd line. If you're running Windows, I recommend [cmder](http://cmder.net) but the powershell or any command line will do (these are already installed by default on your computer).

You can develop Android and iOS apps on Windows, Mac or Linux. However to publish iOS apps to the App Store you will need a Mac. There are two options for developing apps with React Native.

## Option 1: using an emulator

You may use an Android or iOS emulator directly on your laptop (no smartphone needed). You'll find the instructions in the React Native docs [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started) in the "Building Projects with Native Code" tab.

_This option will allow you to develop iOS apps on a Mac **or** Android apps on any platform._ Make sure to run Android Studio or Xcode at least once to make sure all is good.

## Option 2: using your Android or iOS device

You can also use your smartphone to develop your app. For this, you'll need:

- An Android phone with Android 4.4 or later, or an iPhone with iOS 9 or later.
- The Expo app installed on your phone.

Open the camera app on your phone and point it to one of these QR codes to get Expo straight from the Play Store/App Store:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">Expo for Android</td>
    <td align="center">Expo for iOS</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
      <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent">
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frnkly/react-native-tutorial/stable/tutorials/qr-code-expo-android.png" />
      </a>
    </td>
    <td align="center">
      <a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/expo-client/id982107779">
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frnkly/react-native-tutorial/stable/tutorials/qr-code-expo-ios.png" />
      </a>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

_This option will allow you to develop iOS and Android apps **on any platform**._

# Software setup

Once you've decided which option is right for you, make sure the following software are also installed on your machine:

- [Node & NPM](https://nodejs.org)
- [Expo](https://docs.expo.io)
