# Timeline

You can expect this workshop to take up at least 2 hours.

## Prep

If possible, try to get there ahead of time to greet students and get settled in.

- Launch your emulator:
- Open some resources in your browser:
  - https://alternativeto.net/software/sublime-text
  - https://pusher.com/chatkit
  - https://momentjs.com
  - The Yakitty user's list.
- Show the README page on the projector, so that students can open the bit.ly link as they settle in.
- Get everyone to install the Expo app on their phones and machines. They can also create a free account on [expo.io](https://expo.io), but should be able to develop without one.
- Take out your notebook, if you'd like to take notes or write down feedback.
- Grab some water, and enjoy yourself :)

## First hour

- Introduce yourself: _~5 mins_
  - Who are you? What do you do? What are your hobbies?
  - Make sure everyone can hear you well.
  - Try to get a feel for the audience. Do they have programming experience? React or React-Native experience? iOS or Android?
- [First things first](https://github.com/frnkly/react-native-tutorial#first-things-first): _~10 mins_
  - Expect some to not have Expo installed.
  - Whoever doesn't have a smartphone should install an emulator. Let them install it while you start the workshop.
- [Terminal basics](https://github.com/frnkly/react-native-tutorial#terminal-basics): _~5 mins_
  - Go over some basics.
  - Make sure everyone knows how to follow the README in case they fall behind.
- [Getting started](https://github.com/frnkly/react-native-tutorial#getting-started): _~5 mins_
  - This is really just to make sure everyone is up and running.
- [React Native basics](https://github.com/frnkly/react-native-tutorial#react-and-react-native-basics): _~5 mins_
  - Ease the class into the code, but don't spend too much time here. There will be plenty of discovering to do during the workshop.
- [Creating components](https://github.com/frnkly/react-native-tutorial#creating-our-components): _~25 mins_

This adds up to a total of 55 mins or so.

## Break

Make it long enough so everyone can use the restrooms if needed or catch-up on the code, but not so long that they get too distracted. Anywhere between 5 and 10 mins is usually good enough.

## Second hour

- [Using state](https://github.com/frnkly/react-native-tutorial#using-state): _~20 mins_
- [API](https://github.com/frnkly/react-native-tutorial#apis-and-chatkit): _~25 mins_
