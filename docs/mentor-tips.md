# Mentor tips

So you'll be helping to train the next wave of top notch React Native developers. _Fantastic._

It's a good idea to [go through workshop](https://github.com/frnkly/react-native-tutorial) to understand what's going on. If you have the time to actually build the app and follow the tutorial beforehand, even better! An hour or two with Facebook's [online tutorials](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/tutorial) will bring you up to speed with React Native as well.

The main things to keep in mind are:

- It's all just javascript.
- If something breaks at the first step, try again.
- Students should be following along in the docsâ€”there are some tips there in case something doesn't work.
- If possible, students should write down the things that don't work or aren't clear. They can share feedback with me by email or on the feedback page :point_right: [bit.ly/yakitty-feedback](http://bit.ly/yakitty-feedback)
- Mentors can/should ask questions too ;)

Most importantly, enjoy yourself :) and be patient with the students!
