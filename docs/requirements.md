# Requirements

So you want to build a mobile app. The first thing you'll need for this tutorial is a computer with a code editor such as:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- [Sublime Text](https://sublimetext.com)
- [Brackets](http://brackets.io)
- Other options: https://alternativeto.net/software/sublime-text

We will also be using the terminal/comamnd line. If you're running Windows, I recommend [cmder](http://cmder.net) but the powershell or any command line will do (these are already installed by default on your computer).

You can develop Android and iOS apps on Windows, Mac or Linux. However to publish iOS apps to the App Store you will need a Mac. There are two options for developing apps with React Native.

## Option 1

You can use your Android or iPhone device to develop your app. For this, you'll need:

- An Android phone with Android 4.4 or later, or an iPhone with iOS 9 or later.
- The Expo client installed on your phone.

      </a>

</table>

## Option 2

You can also use an emulator on your laptop. You'll find the instructions in the React Native docs here https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started (in the "Building Projects with Native Code" tab).

Make sure to run Android Studio or Xcode at least once to make sure all is good. We will also install the following software together, but feel free to get a head start (especially if you opted for using an emulator):

- [Node & NPM](https://nodejs.org)
- [Expo](https://docs.expo.io)
