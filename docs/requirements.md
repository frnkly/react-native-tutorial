# Requirements

A computer with a code editor such as:

- Visual Studio Code (code.visualstudio.com)
- Sublime Text (sublimetext.com)
- Brackets (brackets.io)
- Other options: https://alternativeto.net/software/sublime-text

We will also be using the terminal/comamnd line. If you're running Windows, I recommend cmder (cmder.net) but the powershell or any command line will do (these are already installed by default on your computer).

You can develop Android apps on Windows, Mac or Linux. However to publish iOS apps you will need a Mac. There are two options for developing apps with React Native.

## Option 1

You can use your Android or iPhone device to see the mobile app. For this, you'll need:

- An Android phone with Android 4.4 or later, or an iPhone with iOS 9 or later.
- The Expo client installed on your phone.
- Your USB or Lightning cable to connect your phone to your laptop.

      </a>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Option 2

You can also use an emulator on your laptop. You'll find the instructions in the React Native docs here https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started (in the "Building Projects with Native Code" tab).

Make sure to run Android Studio or Xcode at least once to make sure all is good. We will also install the following software together, but feel free to get a head start (especially if you opted for using an emulator):

- Node & NPM (nodejs.org)
- Expo (docs.expo.io)
